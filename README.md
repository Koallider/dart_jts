dart_jts is an ongoing effort to port the Java Topology Suite to the dart programming language and make it available to its mobile, dektop and web environments.

dart_jts is derivative work of __[JTS Topology Suite](https://github.com/locationtech/jts)__.

This is currently developed by [HydroloGIS](http://www.hydrologis.com).

Contributions are very welcome. Please, if you port some code over from JTS java, also bring in the testcases. Without them we will not accept the pull requests. Thank you!
